Project Title:

NanoMOS Explorer â€” An Interactive Simulation Tool for Nanoscale Transistor Characteristics


---

Objective:

The goal of this project is to create an interactive web-based tool that allows users to explore and understand the behavior of nanoscale MOSFETs by adjusting key parameters and visualizing the results in real-time. This project focuses on providing a practical simulation of the characteristics of multi-gate MOSFETs (e.g., FinFETs), commonly used in advanced semiconductor devices.

Key Features:

1. Interactive Controls:

Users can dynamically adjust parameters like Gate Voltage, Oxide Thickness, Channel Length, and Carrier Mobility using sliders.

Real-time display of the current parameter values.



2. I-V Characteristics Calculation:

The tool calculates and displays the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics based on user input.

Instant feedback provided when parameters are modified.



3. CSV Data Export:

Users can download their simulation data as a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.



4. 3D Visualization:

Real-time 3D visualization of a transistor using the Three.js library.

The transistor model rotates for better viewing and understanding of its structure.



5. Responsive UI Design:

Modern and clean user interface with CSS styles for enhanced user experience.

Responsive design for mobile and desktop use.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: For structuring the web content.

CSS3: For styling and responsive design.

JavaScript: For interactivity, dynamic calculations, and 3D visualization.

Three.js: For rendering 3D models and visualization.

Blob API: For generating and downloading CSV data.

Files:

1. index.html

Main HTML file containing the structure and layout of the web interface.



2. styles.css

Stylesheet for layout, colors, and responsive design.



3. script.js

JavaScript file for handling interactions, calculations, and 3D visualization.
